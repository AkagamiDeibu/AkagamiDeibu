# About

**`(Student) (Web Dev)`**

Hi, I'm Dave Jornales, and you can call me Dave or Takezo. I'm a student at the Technological University of the Philippines, taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I am a 2nd-year student and I want to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I only have a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Front-End Web Development, and I know the basics of Python, Java, C++, and C.
